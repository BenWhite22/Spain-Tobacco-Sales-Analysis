# Spain-Tobacco-Sales-Analysis

My work is spread across 4 notebooks:

1. The Deloitte Tobacco Sales – Analysis file is where the bulk of my analysis was performed, including building the preliminary model.

2. The Deloitte Tobacco Sales - Tobacco Prices Web Scraping notebook was used for scraping tobacco price date from the El Precio del Tabaco website using Beautiful Soup, which was then used in notebook 1.

3. Notebook Deloitte Tobacco Sales - Sales per Province Map Plot was used for creating a map plot of Spain, which is referenced in notebook 1.

4. The Deloitte Tobacco Sales – Final Model file contains my final model which was used to make sales predictions for 2017. The full predictions can be found in ‘2017 Predictions.csv’
